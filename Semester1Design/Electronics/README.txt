## Notes: Electrical Considerations

### Power (safety) Circuitry:
	Decoupling capacitor
	Limitors and protectors (diodes)
	Power monitor System
	Rechargible?
	9-Volt battery used

### Oscillator
	Astable Multiviberator
		BJT <<<
		Lamp
	555 in Astable mode
### Control + Switching
	Physical switch (latch)
	low-Power optocouple + Logic
	Pot (buffer?)
	Voltage divider
	Sweetspot lock, Position marker, or finite state.

### LED Array
	1 color? RGB?
	How Many? Characterize empirically

### Grounding
	Sheet? battery localized?
